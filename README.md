# openBioHacks
Biohacking is a vibrant new movement in the scientific community, in which people apply the hacker methodology to biological systems.
This unique movement has a profound potential to change how we view the biological world, and how we use it to improve our lives.
Biohacking tools, however, are expensive, and this often pushes people away from biohacking before they even have a chance to start. 
This repository seeks to change that.

This page simply seeks to get DIY biotechnology and biohacking tools out into the open. We cannot be held responsible or take credit
